First open the file machine_learning_algorithm_impl.py

import preprocessing as pp
import bag_of_words as bow
import tf_idf as tfi
import modeling as md
import dtree as dt
import knn as k
import Svm as s
import SGD_Svm as sg
import Naive_Bayes as nb
import Gaussian_Naive_Bayes as gnb
import Bernoulli_Naive_Bayes as bnb

give file path to pd.read_csv('training data file path')
for example,
train_data=pd.read_csv('nfr.csv')

save and close the file.
